# PESConnect
This is supposed to be a simple app created by First semester students of PES University which is supposed to be used by PES students to help connect with other fellows to make plans together. This was done as our First Semester Python project.
This code uses simple python tools and basic GUI using the module customtkinter as its UI.
The data is all stored and used from CSV's which are the users.csv and events.csv.
